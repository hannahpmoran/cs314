# Data Card: A Week of Coffee Breaks

Inspired by the '[Dear Data]([url](https://www.dear-data.com/theproject))' project, this Data Card visualized a "week's" worth of "coffee" breaks for me. The process actually lasted for ten days, and I recorded tea breaks in addition to coffee ones. 

The final version of the project exists as a physical piece of paper, however, I have scanned it to upload on my repo.
